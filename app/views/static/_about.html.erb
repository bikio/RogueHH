  <p> Hidden Hook is your source for premium flies, customized or selected from our current favorites. Every fly that leaves our shop is spun with top-of-the-line materials and components. At Hidden Hook we take pride in each fly that leaves the vice and guarantee their flawless performance. Each fly is hand tied by Hidden Hook founder Rudy Babikian.

  Rudy was taught how to tie simple patterns when he was still shuffling around in a diaper. He was given his first tying vice when he was five years old by his father, George Babikian, an avid fly fisherman. Through his continued passion of fishing and tying, Rudy has become an accomplished tyer himself. See some of his favorite flies below.
    
  In addition to our proven flies and colors, we offer custom flies, from small changes to a current fly to a completely new design. We thrive in our ability to adapt to changes in fish behavior, different fish species, and environments through customization. Contact us today for custom flies perfectly suited to your needs.
